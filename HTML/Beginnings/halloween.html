            <h3>Transformation</h3>
            <p>
            One of Halloween's main themes is transformation. During autumn, 
            many things change from the weather to people. For example after 
            harvest, the eariler crops wither and die once the weather turns 
            cold. An example of this is the pumpkin despite being the icon 
            of Halloween. When people carve pumpkins into jack-o-laterns, there
            is a change because the pumpkin is alive until it is cut thus 
            becoming dead. Another crop that transforms is corn. During the 
            hot months, we know corn grows in a cron field. When the fall comes
            corn is harvested from their big stalks.<br></p>

            <h3>Mystery</h3>
            <p>
                Another theme of Halloween is mystery especially during the season.
                It is said during Halloween, unexplained things happen. Things go 
                bump into the night while others can hear a witch's cackle in the 
                forest. People get into many accidents they can not explain such 
                toes stubs, arm pinches when no one is there, and falling objects 
                at random places. Another thing when it comes to mystery is 
                unexplained deaths. Halloween is often one of most popular time 
                for deaths. This theme goes hand in hand with supernatual elements.

            <h3>Supernatural</h3>
            <p>Halloween is full of the unknown. There are many spirits and beings 
            associated with the mysterious holiday. An example includes the Devil from

            be at its thinnest. So, beings such as ghosts </p>
