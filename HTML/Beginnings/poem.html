            Ah, a beautiful day in the sky!<br>
            The sun is shining and the birds are singing<br>
            I know today will be a good day<br> 
            It is hot but the heat will not ruin today<br> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I walk down the street past the zooming cars<br> 
            With their loud engines and speeding tires<br> 
            I cross the street to my bus stop where the clouds are<br>
            They look so fluffy like cotton in my pillow<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Today is definietly a beautiful day after all!
